# 3D-Printing-
In this project, we simulated 3D printing, or additive manufacturing, in Abaqus CAE.  Due to the complexity of the project, we used Python scripting for the simulation. Additionally, we utilized the DISP and USDFLD subroutines in Fortran Languages.

The main package, available on the CAE Assistant website, allows you to download all the simulation files. Furthermore, 270 minutes of instructional videos are also provided. In the GitHub repository, we have included only a portion of the Python file and part of the Fortran subroutine file for the simulation, which you can access.
